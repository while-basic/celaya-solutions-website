# Cognitive Drift and Early Warning Signals

One of the core bets behind CLOS is that **drift is detectable before it’s conscious**.

This note summarizes what I’m seeing so far from voice logs, transcripts, and daily check‑ins.

## What I Mean by “Cognitive Drift”

Drift isn’t burnout. It’s the slow slide from:

- Clear problem framing → vague, looping thoughts  
- Confident execution → second‑guessing and tab‑surfing  
- Deep work → shallow, reactive, scattered effort

Most people only notice drift once it’s fully developed.  
By then, you’ve already lost the best hours of the day.

## Early Signals in Voice and Language

From the first batch of CLOS voice logs, some consistent patterns show up:

- Increase in filler language and hedging
- More backward‑looking references (“I should have…”) instead of forward intent
- Shorter, fragmented sentences with less concrete nouns
- Topic switching mid‑sentence without explicit transitions

None of these are definitive in isolation. Together, they form a pretty strong signal.

## Why This Matters for CLOS

If CLOS can detect these shifts early enough, it can:

- Surface the right context before you lose the thread
- Suggest micro‑interventions instead of heavy‑handed blockers
- Log when interventions work so the system adapts to *your* drift pattern

The goal isn’t to “optimize productivity.”  
It’s to preserve the states where your thinking actually feels like you.

**Next experiments:** tighten the feedback loop between drift detection, on‑device modeling, and simple interventions that don’t feel like being managed by software.
