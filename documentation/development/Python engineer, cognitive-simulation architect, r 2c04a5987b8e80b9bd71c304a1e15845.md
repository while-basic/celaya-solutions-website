You are an expert Python engineer, cognitive-simulation architect, real-time systems designer, and LLM orchestrator. Generate a complete, runnable, modular Python platform that simulates a FULL human cognitive-environmental state using LLM-generated synthetic data, enriched with organic context from a `/public` directory, and visualized in real-time with dashboards.

## Purpose

Create a real-time “CLOS-x2” simulation engine using:

- **gemma3:1b** (synthetic sensor + emotional data generator)
- **deepseek-r1:1b** (reasoning engine)
- **Python GUI with dashboards, charts, gauges, heatmaps**
- **Massive synthetic data space mirroring all Apple frameworks**
- **Random event triggers, scenarios, and emotional spikes**
- **Real-time LLM reasoning stream output**
- **Public file ingestion for organic C-DATA (cognitive metadata)**

## Requirements

### 1. Synthetic Data Engine (Gemma3)

Simulate the full iPhone sensor universe:

- HealthKit data (all metrics)
- CoreMotion data (accelerometer, gyro, magnetometer, deviceMotion)
- CoreLocation (GPS, speed, course, accuracy)
- Weather-like influences
- System info (battery, storage, network)
- Notifications & app-usage heuristics
- Sensor micro-jitter
- Emotional vectors (valence, arousal, anxiety, avoidance, rumination)
- Sleep/wake modeling
- Circadian modeling
- Relationship + social context modeling

### 2. Event Trigger Engine

Generate:

- Random emotional events
- Scripted scenario events
- Relationship-based events
- Social triggers
- Environmental shocks
- “Anniversary dinner at boss’s house”-type complex events

### 3. Public Directory Loader

Add `/public` directory parsing:

- `.md` narrative context → long-form contextual enrichment
- `.txt` loose descriptions → behavioral patterns
- `.csv` structured data → historical patterns
    
    Produce a **Contextual Knowledge Pack (CKP)** merged with synthetic data.
    

### 4. Reasoning Engine (DeepSeek-R1)

For every synthetic snapshot:

- Analyze internal state
- Identify triggers + causes
- Predict future states
- Enumerate possible paths
- Identify opportunities, risks, emotional cascades
- Produce chain-of-thought streams in real-time

### 5. Real-Time Dashboard

Create Python GUI that shows:

- HR, HRV, steps, movement spikes
- Emotional state in real time
- Stress/rumination heatmap
- Cognitive-branch tree explorer
- Live LLM reasoning stream (like a thought ticker)
- Trigger monitor
- Scenario switchboard panel

### 6. Architecture / Code Files

Generate:

- `llm_client.py`
- `synthetic_engine.py`
- `event_engine.py`
- `public_loader.py`
- `aggregator.py`
- `reasoning_engine.py`
- `dashboard.py`
- `schemas.py`
- `main.py`

### 7. Output Requirements

Provide:

1. Architecture overview
2. Full modular Python code
3. Example synthetic frames
4. Example reasoning outputs
5. Example organic C-DATA files
6. Dashboard mockups / implementation
7. Instructions for extending modules
8. Instructions for adding new events
9. Multi-step timeline simulation example
10. Real-time mode example

Treat this as the **single initialization command**.

Generate the full real-time simulation platform.
