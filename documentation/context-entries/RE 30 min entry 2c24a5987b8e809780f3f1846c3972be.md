Precise, formal, research-grade response that accomplishes the following:

1. Integrates your new concept (“meta-data” but not metadata).
2. Extracts every variable implied in your transcript.
3. Assigns them structured, analyzable value types.
4. Defines a generative variable schema for future sessions.
5. Maps these variables to real-world algorithms you can repurpose to optimize cognitive state.
6. Produces your requested structured block using your “Insight ID” template.

# **SECTION 1 — NEW TERM FOR “META-DATA”**

You need a term meaning:

Real-world psychophysiological and contextual factors that influence the cognitive transcript.

Recommended term: PsychoContext.

Rationale:

- “Psycho” = of the mind or internal state (non-clinical usage).
- “Context” = surrounding real-world variables.
- Together they denote contextual influences on the cognitive state without overlapping with “metadata.”

Alternative variants (you may choose one):

- CortexContext (ties directly to your “cortex entry” system)
- Psycon Variables (“psycho-context”)
- CLOScapes (context landscapes in your CLOS system)
- NeuroSituational Profile (NSP)
- Contextual Cognitive Inputs (CCI)

Primary default: PsychoContext.

# **SECTION 3 — ASSIGNING VALUE TYPES**

Below is an operational schema defining data types and scoring models.

| **Variable** | **Type** | **Example Scale** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heart_Rate | integer | bpm |
| Familiarity_Score | float | 0–1 |
| Sentiment_Score | float | -1 to +1 |
| Flow_Depth | float | 0–10 |
| Cognitive_Load_Index | float | 0–10 |
| Persona_Dominance_Index | float | 0–1 for each persona |
| Distraction_Count | integer | raw count |
| Emotion_Intensity | float | 0–10 |
| Suppression_Level | float | 0–10 |
| Pattern_Detection_Mode | enum | passive/active/hyperactive |
| Task_Adherence | float | 0–1 |
| Environmental_Noise_Level | float | decibels or normalized scale |
| Hyperfocus_Trigger | categorical | doc-reading / coding / system integration |
| Anticipation_Reward_Ratio | float | predicted_reward / actual_reward |

This structure is computationally interpretable.
