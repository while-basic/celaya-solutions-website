# Context Entry Pre Studio

Last edited time: December 8, 2025 3:09 AM

December 7th. 2025, Sunday. Also known as Sunday fun day. Time is 7:17 PM. Destination, studio, one stop before studio, of some material, then I'm going to studio, but I just wanted to time to decompress and empty the cash mentally before I have to. Change my mental personas and or be present in person and perform at an optimal focus. Operation. Basically need to give myself some rules, ground enrolled how to, what I need to focus on. Go get hands. They focus on what we're talking about. Don deviate. Don't use curiosity, don't, do any of that, because I'm there to present myself as a professional individual. For and I'm requested to deliver a certain level of quality. This is because I've, Raised the bar and utilized. I've somehow figured out how to utilize deficiencies into operations and accelerators. Such as my, my compulsive test work, well, so the numbers and details, hyper focused on details, possibilities of things that could go wrong, how to capture them before, even something, think that could be possible. I want to think of 20 steps ahead using 1000000s of LLMs and sequence on one of the plan every possible, possible, scenario, the details possible. kind of like with the vendors. Dr. Strange goes and looks at all the realities. And I want to decompress math, please. Tell myself that acknowledge myself, what I've achieved so far. Most things I've achieved are to know. The initiative I took influenced by boredom, frustration, and all sorts of other emotional pains and stressors that are involved in my life because I didn't know what to do with it. I was bored. That's a good note and thing to put some weight on a word would be boredom. Eventually, you will figure out something that you did not actually intend on discovering or doing. Your mind will find a way. like a plant improves. will find a way. This is inevitable. Biological creatures are branding doing stuff that we are not even aware of, we voluntarily, so I need to make sure, like, I do maintain a schematic system of operation. Not a sequence of procedures. system of operation. Because this operation, we have to be able to prohibit, in different tents, understand how to handle. At any expected time. Also other medical processes that are even making sure I'm aware of certain trips. Hausing before I speak. You need a lot of, enough time, fully analyzed and comprehensible, was always melt. So, I need to do that. I also need to maintain the persona on the surface level, in real world, on the outside, how do I how am I being received by others? I will do a flight out to make the mansion of a coat. Or crave it that that happens on November. But the carrier made a comment that JB still an emotion, what was I familiar with? Recognizing familiarity caused me to just immediately. Just had a stacked moment. Well, it didn't. Taking a moment to reflect myself. And it sounds professional that I'm gonna be working with right now, good. My son did venture a gray area. I say great because there's interest, but there's also no interest. He lacked the mutual necessary requirement to achieve an outcome, my professional one. Professional is somewhat straightforward. If you encourage us to speak about it. Clients and reaction was. I don't know what to do because I did not have any. recognizable occurrence that happened prior to that moment. I mean, there's no plan that was already written, there was a number procedure for that because it was something that I had. They have been requested of me, so he was kind of, I didn't have a plan, have contact, no procedure. I delayed my response by stating I needed time to think about, like, this situation. After I had to think, I returned back with my response, card, plan, well thought out. With the projection, that was the same rejection, but this was not in her favor. It was something she had planned for, considered, but that was not something that, that happened to my brain. The relationship has strengthened since then, because initially my here is to match the ideal relationship and create a collaboration that we currently have, right? Last year, friendship, quality, and strength, has growers, my control. Individual is allowed me to express my thoughts openly. Even knowing myself consciousness, awareness, one of the matters, and how it makes me feel. I love myself to step out of character. Christopher, research Christopher, needs to come down and dial it down to about 5%. Auto 100, Mr. Chris. Still sustainable at the 25 apology correction 33 South, it is 25 is correct. Reminder and idea, voice #Smart Reminders, just do what I wanna do is leave myself a punctuation. I'm gonna speak. His voice, this audio gets transcribed into text. The tech became certain characters and strings. I can hear my voice, use certain words and number or sequences, to create a signal for the model, and the model could do something with those signals, flags, so in the case, if I say reminder, or just hash REM. Hash for mine. I will come up with a arrangement of all sorts of different hard-coded Voice coffins for code. Oh yes, we gotta figure out something funny to call it. There's potentially the magic happens where the LLM does the transcription. And when it recognizes a certain strength, and specific arrangement, it will do something with that stuff. That information. If it's easy, the bad semantic, you match meaning, so that makes things super powerful. Naturally, more by dimensional. Oh, matrix for sure. That'd be cool to know the map on that. You know, just see the place you like. Another cool thing would be like just a simple web app where I use pseudo code and I actually get like a mathematical information out of it. So, like, right now, that is a genius idea. I do not have time to stop what I'm doing, pull out my phone, not in decisions, or the place, like driving, so I can't pull out my phone, to take the note of that genius I did, so I'm recording right now, but I still haven't touched my phone, because it's already recording, plus another benefit, long term recording. Or the model list for specific keyword terms, whatever, and then it does something with that information. So in this case, I'm talking about this natural language, equation visualizer, regenerator, whatever, you know, a model. I could say, amplify ideas, which is like makes the priority a little higher. So when the model is processing, it's just because I'm, so I'm, I need it. I'm need it right above. This is a to do tag. It's a good voice tag. So when I get home and I process this information later, I can have our visions happen so like add to voice memo ideas or whatever. So whatever I've verbalized, it's transcribed, caught by an LLM. So, analysis procedure. And in that, in that part of the sequence or procedure, people process against the context again, specifically for those terms. So, I think the way people are using the way I see people using AI right now. is by just dumping the whole horse beans or durgent their, it's like frogois. Of course, we need context, the whole budget, and they want the models to do everything with it, but it might give the model a step by step, particular of operations, not, yes, the sequence of operation. Actually, procedures with operations. Like, not a contention, or like, like, not tender, but, if they, you have, an array for models. each bottle is different. Each model, so then, need a set, or, uh, a bunch of data, markdown, and TSE format, including the channel. And their task in their assignment. And the assignment contains a bunch of procedures. In group formation. Each group is going to focus on collecting and extracting specific things so one will be looking out for sentiment analysis. I wanna look out for grammar level. Look out for, uh, variancy, variable value. So if there's a change in the heart rate, when certain words wind up together, so that's great for semantic. I got to figure out how to connect the semantic memory. And match it with what happened throughout the course of time? So in this moment of recording this cortex, this context entry, how many times did I say a word that were linked to an emotional memory or feeling, whatever? How often do they occur? What are their patterns? How can we prevent and accelerate them? Reduce menopause effects, edit, their meanings, trying to, the brain's functionality in X code, using natural language. Oh, if you could bring this to an end, and you get all research, Chris needs to stop. and find a stop before I do that as a stopping point so. Verbal voice tag command. With automated, made it triggers. Nah, so I'm not my destination for the supplies, so we're gonna end this one at 735 PM, December 7, 2025 mode. Com. Anxiety. I wanna say about 50% happiness, 50%. mood up to 50% zero, 0%. Worries, about 75%. Self-consciousness orness. We're over clocked.
