## Mindset Reminders

**Week 1 Goals:**
1. ✅ Get something out there
2. ✅ Start the habit
3. ✅ Make it easy to continue
4. ❌ Don't aim for viral
5. ❌ Don't compare to established accounts
6. ❌ Don't wait for perfection

**Remember:**
- Progress > Perfection
- Consistency > Intensity  
- Authenticity > Polish
- Long-term > Short-term

**You're playing a different game:**
Not trying to get internet famous.
Trying to document research and find collaborators.
Audience growth is a byproduct, not the goal.

- Voice record your thoughts
- Transcribe and light edit

**On engagement:**
