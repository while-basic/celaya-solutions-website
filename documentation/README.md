## Project Overview

CLOS is a research apparatus for studying:
- Flow states and cognitive optimization
- Human-AI augmented cognition
- Computational phenomenology
- Self-experimental research methodologies
- Pattern recognition in cognitive processes

The system serves both as a personal cognitive optimization tool and as a research platform for contributing novel knowledge to computational neuroscience and cognitive science.

## Research Goals

1. **Reverse-engineer cognitive processes** - Systematic decomposition of cognitive architecture
2. **Mathematical formalization** - Create quantitative models of flow states and cognitive patterns
3. **Replicable frameworks** - Develop methodologies others can use
4. **Intellectual contribution** - Achieve recognition through academic citation and research impact
