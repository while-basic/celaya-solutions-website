# Working with Chris: A Collaboration Guide

**Maximizing Effectiveness in Professional Interactions**

---

## Quick Start: The Essentials

**If you only read one section, read this:**

Chris operates best when you:

1. **Lead with the problem, not the prescription** - Define what needs solving, not how to solve it
2. **Bring data and specifics** - Vague requests get vague responses; precision gets precision
3. **Skip the corporate theater** - He responds to substance, not process for its own sake
4. **Give him room to think** - Best solutions come from deep work, not immediate responses
5. **Expect questions that reframe the problem** - This isn’t resistance; it’s optimization

---

## Communication Protocol

### When You Need Something From Chris

**DO:**

- State the core problem clearly: “We’re losing $X on wire waste”
- “I need help to better understand how to install a Ring Floodlight in my backyard.”
- Provide relevant constraints: timeline, budget, technical limitations
- Share existing data or analysis you already have
- Specify your actual goal, not just the task: “Need to impress leadership” vs. “Make a report”
- Ask “What would you need to solve this?” if you’re unsure

**DON’T:**

- Send vague requests like “Can you look into this when you get a chance?”
- Provide solutions looking for validation: “Can you just run these numbers?”
- Interrupt deep work for non-urgent clarifications
- Mistake his questioning your approach for resistance
- Expect immediate responses to complex questions

**Example Request Patterns:**

❌ *“Hey, can you help with something?”*

✅ *“We’re getting complaints about response time on the PLCs. Do you have time this week to look at the data logs?”*

❌ *“Management wants a report on efficiency.”*

✅ *“Management wants to understand where we’re losing time in the installation process. I have last quarter’s data. Can you identify the bottlenecks?”*

### Response Time Expectations

- **Urgent technical issues**: Immediate to same-day
- **Complex analytical requests**: 2-3 days for initial assessment
- **Strategic/innovation projects**: He’ll likely be thinking about it continuously, provide updates when he has meaningful progress
- **Administrative/routine items**: May need a reminder—these aren’t his natural priority

### Communication Style He Responds To

**Technical Peers:**

- Direct, precise language
- Challenge his assumptions with data or logic
- Ask “why” questions about his methodology
- Engage with the technical details—he enjoys this

**Management/Leadership:**

- Provide strategic context for why something matters
- Frame requests around business outcomes and ROI
- Trust his technical judgment on implementation
- Ask about tradeoffs and alternatives rather than micromanaging approach

**Cross-Functional Colleagues:**

- Be explicit about what you need and why
- Don’t assume he knows the business context—explain it
- Ask him to translate technical concepts if needed
- Give him visibility into downstream impacts of his work

## Collaboration Dynamics

### In Meetings

**What Works:**

- Problem-solving sessions with clear objectives
- Technical deep-dives where expertise is needed
- Strategy discussions about future capabilities
- Post-mortems analyzing what went wrong

**What Doesn’t:**

- Status update meetings that could be emails
- Meetings without clear agendas or decisions to make
- Excessive consensus-building on technical decisions
- Theater: meetings held to “show we’re addressing it”

**His Contribution Style:**

- May be quiet initially while processing
- Questions that seem tangential are usually identifying edge cases
- If he says “that won’t work,” he’s likely already mentally tested it—ask why
- Often has considered implications others haven’t noticed

### On Project Teams

**Optimal Role:**

- Technical lead on complex problems
- Architecture and systems design
- Data analysis and optimization work
- Innovation R&D where failure is acceptable

**Less Optimal:**

- Routine execution of well-defined processes
- Heavy coordination/administrative roles
- Politics-heavy initiatives requiring constant stakeholder management
- Tasks requiring strict adherence to methodology over results

**Team Dynamics:**

- Doesn’t need social bonding to work effectively—respects competence over camaraderie
- Appreciates when people own their domain expertise
- Will help others solve technical problems if asked directly
- Not naturally political—won’t intuit unspoken organizational dynamics

### Conflict Resolution

**If You Disagree With His Approach:**

1. **Challenge with specifics**: “I’m concerned about X because of Y” not “I’m not sure about this”
2. **Ask about his reasoning**: “Walk me through why you chose this approach”
3. **Bring alternative data**: He responds to evidence, not authority or consensus
4. **Focus on constraints he may have missed**: “Did you consider the maintenance burden?”
5. **Separate technical disagreement from personal conflict**: He can debate approaches without it being personal

**Signs He’s Frustrated (and why):**

- Asking pointed questions about requirements → You haven’t defined the actual problem
- Pushing back on timelines → The request doesn’t match complexity
- Going quiet in meetings → Discussion has become unproductive theater
- Over-explaining technical details → He feels his expertise is being dismissed

## Getting the Best Results

### Project Setup

**Define Success Clearly:**

- Not: “Improve the system”
- Yes: “Reduce downtime by 15% or identify why that’s not feasible”

**Provide Context:**

- Why does this matter to the business?
- Who will use this/be impacted?
- What happens if we don’t solve it?
- What’s the actual timeline vs. the desired timeline?

**Resource Clarity:**

- What can he access (data, systems, budget)?
- Who can he pull in for specialized knowledge?
- What are the real constraints vs. preferences?

### During Execution

**Give Autonomy:**

- Check in on progress and blockers, not methodology
- If his approach differs from your expectation, ask why before redirecting
- Let him optimize the solution—he’s probably found a better way

**Support Effectively:**

- Remove organizational blockers
- Provide air cover for unconventional approaches
- Get him access to people/data/resources he requests
- Translate his technical work to stakeholders if needed

**Red Flags to Watch:**

- He stops asking questions → May have disengaged or feels input isn’t valued
- Requests become overly conservative → He’s optimizing for approval rather than results
- Technical depth decreases → He’s stopped caring about the problem

### Feedback & Recognition

**What Motivates Him:**

- Solving genuinely difficult problems
- Autonomy to pursue elegant solutions
- Recognition for innovation and impact
- Opportunities to work on emerging technologies
- Freedom from bureaucratic overhead

**What Doesn’t:**

- Generic praise without understanding the work
- Recognition for doing “what he’s supposed to do”
- Process compliance awards
- Social/team-building rewards

**Effective Feedback:**

- Specific and technical: “The way you structured the data model solved the scaling issue”
- Impact-focused: “This saved us $50K and opened up three new capabilities”
- Growth-oriented: “Have you considered applying this approach to [other problem]?”
- Direct about shortcomings: “This analysis is strong but the presentation won’t land with leadership—here’s why”

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario: “I need this by end of day”

**His likely response:** Questions about scope or pushback on timeline

**What’s happening:** He’s doing fast triage—can he deliver something valuable in that timeframe, or will rushing produce garbage?

**Your move:**

- Clarify what “good enough” looks like for this deadline
- Ask what he can deliver today vs. what would take longer
- If it’s truly urgent, explain why (this helps him prioritize)

### Scenario: “He’s working on something I didn’t assign”

**His likely response:** He identified a problem or opportunity

**What’s happening:** His brain naturally gravitates toward optimization—he may have found something more valuable than the assigned task

**Your move:**

- Ask what he’s working on and why
- Evaluate if it’s actually higher value
- If you need him back on task, explain the priority tradeoff explicitly

### Scenario: “He’s challenging the requirements”

**His likely response:** Detailed questions about constraints and objectives

**What’s happening:** He’s trying to solve the real problem, not just execute a request

**Your move:**

- Separate non-negotiable constraints from preferences
- Explain the reasoning behind requirements
- Be open to his optimizations unless there’s a real blocker

### Scenario: “I don’t understand his explanation”

**His likely response:** More technical detail (which may not help)

**What’s happening:** He’s defaulting to precision over accessibility

**Your move:**

- “Can you explain this assuming I don’t know [technical concept]?”
- “What’s the practical implication for [business outcome]?”
- “Give me the version for leadership”

## Working Styles Compatibility Matrix

### High Compatibility:

- **Technical leads who value innovation**: Mutual respect for expertise
- **Results-focused managers**: Clear goals, autonomy on execution
- **Data-driven decision makers**: Shared language and values
- **Other deep specialists**: Appreciates domain mastery

### Requires Adaptation:

- **Process-oriented colleagues**: May need to explain why steps matter
- **Relationship-focused managers**: Won’t naturally provide social bonding
- **Consensus builders**: Prefers optimal solution over group agreement
- **Politics-navigators**: Doesn’t intuit organizational dynamics

### Potential Friction:

- **Micromanagers**: Will disengage if not trusted
- **Authority-driven leaders**: Responds to logic, not hierarchy
- **Those threatened by questioning**: His questions aren’t challenges to authority
- **Status quo protectors**: He naturally disrupts existing approaches

## The Bottom Line

Chris is a **high-trust, high-autonomy** collaborator. The investment required is clear problem definition and strategic context. The return is solutions that often exceed the original scope because he’s optimized for the real underlying problem, not just the stated request.

**Treat him like a specialist consultant you’ve hired:** Give him hard problems, provide necessary context and resources, check in on progress, then get out of the way. You’ll get better results than if you try to manage his process.

**The meta-principle:** The more you can operate in “what” and “why” rather than “how,” the more value he’ll deliver. His expertise is in the “how”—let him use it.

## Quick Reference Card

*Print this and keep it handy*

| **When you need…** | **Do this…** |
| --- | --- |
| Quick answer | Be specific about the question and timeline |
| Complex analysis | Define the problem and constraints, give him space |
| Technical implementation | Explain the goal, let him design the approach |
| Him to prioritize your request | Explain the business impact and real deadline |
| To understand his work | Ask for implications/outcomes, not technical details |
| To give feedback | Be specific and direct—what worked, what didn’t, why |

**Remember:** Precision in, precision out. Vagueness in, frustration out.
