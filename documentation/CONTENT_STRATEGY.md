# Build in Public Content Strategy
## Celaya Solutions Research Lab

## Core Positioning

**Primary Message**: "Cognitive systems research, built in public."

**Target Audience**:
1. **Primary**: Technical founders, AI researchers, indie hackers interested in cognitive tools
2. **Secondary**: Potential collaborators, early beta users
3. **Tertiary**: Future consulting clients, investors

**Unique Angle**: 
- Industrial electrical technician → AI researcher
- Mexican American in El Paso building privacy-first tech
- Systems-level thinking across physical/software/cognitive domains
- "Inverse imposter syndrome" - exceptional skills, building in public to prove it

## Content Pillars

### 1. **Research Transparency** (40% of content)
Show the actual work, including:
- Technical specifications and architecture decisions
- Experiment results (positive and negative)
- Code snippets and diagrams
- Performance benchmarks

**Example Topics**:
- "CLOS Architecture: Week 1 Decisions"
- "Why I Chose Llama.cpp Over Cloud APIs"
- "Speech-to-Text Accuracy on Technical Jargon: Results"

### 2. **Cross-Domain Insights** (30% of content)
Your unique perspective bridging domains:
- Electrical systems → Software systems
- Datacenter debugging → Human cognition debugging
- Music production → Software architecture
- Industrial safety → Privacy-first design

**Example Topics**:
- "What Power Distribution Taught Me About Attention Management"
- "Debugging Burnout Like a Faulty Circuit"
- "Music Production Patterns in Code Architecture"

### 3. **Personal Experiments** (20% of content)
Your 90-day protocol and self-experimentation:
- Voice journal analysis findings
- Flow state triggers identified
- Cognitive pattern insights
- Tool effectiveness reviews

**Example Topics**:
- "Week 4 Update: What 28 Days of Voice Journals Revealed"
- "I Tracked Every Context Switch for a Week"
- "How I Reverse-Engineered My Flow States"

### 4. **Tool/Process Sharing** (10% of content)
Practical takeaways people can use:
- MCP server code
- Automation scripts
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Hardware/software setup guides

**Example Topics**:
- "My Voice Capture Workflow (Apple Watch → CLOS)"
- "The MCP Server I Built for Music Production"
- "Local LLM Setup on RTX 3090"

## Publishing Cadence

### Weekly Minimum
- **Monday**: Lab note (research update or insight)
- **Thursday**: Twitter/X thread summarizing the week
- **Sunday**: GitHub commit (code or documentation)

### Monthly Targets
- 4 lab notes
- 1 long-form deep dive (2000+ words)
- 2-3 open source tool releases or updates
- 1 video/screen recording (optional but recommended)

## Platform Strategy

### Primary Platforms

**1. Your Website (celaya.solutions)**
- Host all long-form content
- Central hub for research
- Newsletter signup
- **Publish first**, then syndicate

**2. GitHub (@chriscelaya)**
- All code, specs, documentation
- Use README files as mini-blog posts
- Active issues for community engagement
- **Essential for credibility**

**3. Twitter/X**
- Daily presence, not necessarily daily posts
- Quote-tweet research, respond to relevant threads
- Share progress screenshots
- Build relationships with other builders
- **Discovery engine**

### Secondary Platforms

**4. Dev.to or Hashnode**
- Syndicate technical posts
- Reach developer audience
- SEO benefits
- **Low effort, high reach**

**5. YouTube (Long-term)**
- Screen recordings of builds
- Architecture walkthroughs
- "Build with me" sessions
- **High effort, but sticky audience**

## First 30 Days Content Calendar

### Week 1: Foundation
- **Lab Note**: "Why I'm Building CLOS: The Problem with Current Productivity Tools"
- **GitHub**: Push CLOS architecture documentation
- **Twitter**: Introduction thread + site launch
- **Action**: Set up newsletter

### Week 2: Credibility
- **Lab Note**: "11 Years of Electrical Systems → AI Research: The Unlikely Path"
- **GitHub**: MCP server initial release
- **Twitter**: Thread on cross-domain thinking
- **Action**: Reach out to 10 similar builders

### Week 3: Technical Depth
- **Lab Note**: "Local vs Cloud LLMs: 30 Days of Performance Testing"
- **GitHub**: Voice journal processing pipeline
- **Twitter**: Share interesting findings
- **Action**: Guest on a podcast or Twitter Space

### Week 4: Community
- **Lab Note**: "90-Day Experiment Update: First Insights"
- **GitHub**: Open source utility tool
- **Twitter**: Ask community: "What cognitive tools do you use?"
- **Action**: Feature someone else's work

## Metrics That Matter

### Vanity Metrics (Track but Don't Optimize For)
- Total page views
- Twitter followers
- Newsletter subscribers (initially)

### Real Metrics (Optimize For These)
- **Inbound messages** from interesting people
- **GitHub stars/forks** on actual projects
- **Beta signups** from qualified users
- **Consulting inquiries** from right-fit clients
- **Collaboration proposals** from credible researchers

### Success Indicators (90 Days)
- 10+ meaningful conversations with other builders
- 3+ beta users providing feedback
- 1+ collaboration or consulting opportunity
- 100+ newsletter subscribers (quality over quantity)
- Established as "that person who thinks about X"

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Direct**: Get to the point fast
- **Technical**: Assume audience is technical
- **Honest**: Share failures and uncertainties
- **Unpretentious**: Let work speak, not hype

### Structure (Lab Notes)
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Why this matters
2. **Context** (1 paragraph): What you're solving
3. **Approach** (bulk of content): How you're doing it
4. **Results** (data/insights): What you learned
5. **Next Steps** (optional): Where this is going

### Length Targets
- **Short posts**: 300-500 words (quick updates)
- **Standard posts**: 800-1200 words (most lab notes)
- **Deep dives**: 2000-3000 words (monthly)
- **Twitter threads**: 5-10 tweets max

## Content Repurposing

Every lab note becomes:
1. **Blog post** on your site (primary)
2. **Twitter thread** (next day)
3. **Newsletter** (Friday digest)
4. **Dev.to cross-post** (if relevant)
5. **GitHub README** update (if code-related)

One piece of content → 5 touchpoints

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Do This:
- ❌ Posting just to post (quality > frequency)
- ❌ Engagement bait without substance
- ❌ Vague updates ("making progress!")
- ❌ Only posting wins (show the failures too)
- ❌ Copying others' format without your voice
- ❌ Overexplaining or apologizing
- ❌ Waiting for perfection

### Do This Instead:
- ✅ Post when you have something to say
- ✅ Specific insights and learnings
- ✅ Concrete progress with context
- ✅ Document the messy middle
- ✅ Find your natural voice and rhythm
- ✅ Ship with typos, iterate publicly
- ✅ Publish imperfect work

## Engagement Strategy

### How to Show Up
- Reply to 5-10 relevant tweets daily
- Share others' work (not just your own)
- Ask questions, don't just broadcast
- DM people doing interesting things
- Join relevant Discord/Slack communities

### Who to Connect With
- Other solo builders/researchers
- AI/ML researchers working in public
- Privacy-focused developers
- Cognitive tools/PKM community
- Cross-domain thinkers

## Long-Term Content Goals

### 6 Months
- Established research lab reputation
- Active community following work
- 2-3 open source projects with traction
- Regular consulting inquiries
- Known for specific expertise area

### 12 Months
- Published research paper or significant finding
- CLOS in active beta with users
- Speaking engagements or podcast appearances
- Partnerships or collaborations
- Self-sustaining content/product flywheel

## Key Principle

**Build in public ≠ marketing**

This isn't content marketing. This is:
- Documentation of actual research
- Accountability mechanism
- Network building
- Proof of work
- Learning in public

The byproduct is audience growth. The goal is better research and faster iteration through community feedback.

**Remember**: You have exceptional technical depth and unique cross-domain experience. The only reason people don't know this yet is because you haven't shared it. Build in public solves that.
